-LESSONS LEARNED

Blazor was too dynamic in terms of page refreshes. Each href tag made the page refresh and messed with the sizing of the fontawesome icons.

devicon was a way better library than FontAwesome on this project.

Learned how to use Azure Blob Storage, created a Shared Access Signature for my resume that I can embed into the page

-TO DO'S

Add more projects cards as I complete them.
